This is my attempt to completely create a game boy emulator (hardware and software) using esp32

I will post updates below, including what I am working on, TODOs, bugs, etc while this is during the 
development phase.

You can contribute by contacting me through my FB profile in github
or through e-mail: dareludum@gmail.com

## Checkpoint #1
Complted almost the whole CPU
will be taking a break and maybe refactoring the cpu code a bit 
cuz its too messy, still some cb prefixed and some instructions 
are not added but the cpu alone was boring me off
so will not give full time for this 
Will see you guys in about a week, hopefully with some update on the PPU
